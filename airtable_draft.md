Imagine you were a top airtable engineer - can you build an customer request-to-pdf document generator from fields, which exports a PDF?

The input interface should be a form, which asks for different fields. 
Then there are options to choose the form template to populate.

The output is a PDF with the template populated with the data.

Designing a customer request-to-PDF document generator in Airtable (Omni build concept)
Imagine you're a top Airtable engineer building a customer request form, which your customer service reps will use. 

Here's a prompt-engineered approach to designing a customer request-to-PDF document generator from Airtable fields, with a focus on a smooth, integrated workflow:

## Core functionality:
- User Interface: A well-designed Airtable Form that collects necessary customer information 
```
primary key is policyId
fields {first name, last name, request}

Requests are certain actions: 
requests {addVehicle(), leaveMessage()}

Each request is essentially a function, which takes in a specific parameter:

addVehicle() {}
leaveMessage() {policyId, firstName lastName, phoneNumber, email, reason}
```
- Template Selection: A dropdown or similar mechanism within the Form or a subsequent automation that allows the user to choose from pre-defined PDF document templates, which correspond to requests

- PDF Generation: A robust backend process that dynamically populates the chosen PDF template with data from the submitted form, generating a new PDF document.

- Output: The generated PDF is automatically attached to the corresponding record in Airtable and optionally emailed to the customer and internal team members.


## Key considerations & design choices (Airtable-centric):
Data Structure:
Customer Requests Table: Stores all submitted form data, including fields for customer details, request specifics, and a linked record field to the generated PDF (attachment field).

Templates Table: Stores details about each available PDF template, potentially including a preview or example file, and linked to a Google Doc or other template storage solution.

Supporting Tables (if needed): Additional tables to store details about products, services, or other information that might be included in the generated PDFs, linked back to the Customer Requests table via linked record fields.

Form & User Experience:
Utilize Airtable's native Forms feature for collecting data.
Consider using conditional fields to show/hide relevant fields based on earlier selections in the form (e.g., if "Invoice" template is selected, show quantity and price fields).
Ensure clear and concise field labels and instructions for users.

Automation & Integration (leveraging Airtable Automations & extensions):
Trigger: When a new record is created in the "Customer Requests" table (via the Form).
Action:

Option A (Using a document generation extension): Use a third-party Airtable extension like DocsAutomator or PDF Generator API to create and populate the PDF. Docs Automator offers a "Start Automating Documents" feature. PDF Generator API has a drag-and-drop editor for templates.

Option B (Custom scripting with external APIs): Use an Airtable scripting extension or automation script combined with an external API (like CloudConvert or Google Docs API) to generate the PDF from a template, according to Airtable Community.

Create an HTML version of the document template within Airtable using formula fields and linked record lookups to pull relevant data.

Send this HTML data to the external API to generate the PDF.
Receive the generated PDF from the API and store it in the attachment field of the corresponding Airtable record.

## Template Management:
Use a dedicated table to manage PDF templates, including template names, descriptions, and linked Google Doc or other files acting as the actual template.

Ensure placeholders in templates are clearly defined (e.g., using {{field_name}} syntax) to facilitate data mapping during PDF generation.
Allow users to choose from a list of available templates in the initial Form.

Error Handling & Monitoring:
Set up alerts or notifications if the PDF generation fails for any reason.
Implement logging or tracking mechanisms to monitor the success rate and efficiency of the document generation process.

## Enhanced features (Omni experience):
Customer Portal: Develop an Airtable Interface for customers to submit requests and view their generated documents.
Customization Options: Allow customers to personalize certain aspects of the document (e.g., choose fonts, colors, or add a logo) through form fields or interface elements that influence the template population.

Dynamic Content: Integrate with other data sources or services to pull additional information for the PDFs (e.g., CRM data, inventory details).
Version Control: Track different versions of generated documents and allow access to previous versions.
